[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the [most popular IDE worldwide](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment) amongst beginner and professional programmers.

What does this mean? The language's **low-level** nature enables you, as the developer, to control all aspects of your application. With C++, you can instruct the computer to do almost anything, which is why it is such a powerful language. **general-purpose** means you can use C++ in a variety of scenarios. C++ is used to create other languages such as Java and Python, to create operating systems such as Andriod and Windows, and to develop applications such as Photoshop and Microsoft office.
